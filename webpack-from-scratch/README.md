# webpack from scratch

## Modules

[webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)

webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also
capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

[webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli)

webpack CLI provides a flexible set of commands for developers to increase speed when setting up a custom webpack
project. As of webpack v4, webpack is not expecting a configuration file, but often developers want to create a more
custom webpack configuration based on their use-cases and needs. webpack CLI addresses these needs by providing a set of
tools to improve the setup of custom webpack configuration.

[webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)

Use webpack with a development server that provides live reloading. This should be used for development only.

[html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin)

This is a webpack plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles. This is especially useful
for webpack bundles that include a hash in the filename which changes every compilation. You can either let the plugin
generate an HTML file for you, supply your own template using lodash templates or use your own loader.
